Motivation

We want to create an app where users can brainstorm together. 
They can draw together at the same time on their own tablet/smartphone.
First they connect with a server to build new groups. 
When they finish or out of ideas they can store and reload it from the server 
whenever they want.

Implementation 

-> connection with server 
-> communication via udp
-> just overdrawing things
-> tool for drawing by android -> https://developer.android.com/training/custom-views/custom-drawing.html#overrideondraw

Feature List

- communication via server
- ability to draw down ideas
- every user has a name 
- you can build several groups which you can join 
  (you can only work at on project at the same time) 
- picture is saving automaticaly every second 
  (so joining a group during a brainstorm would not be problem)
