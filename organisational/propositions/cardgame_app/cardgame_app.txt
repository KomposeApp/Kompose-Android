Motivation

We want to create an app where users can play a cardgame (trinkspiel, poker, uno) together.
The goal is to play the game p2p with any device, that supports our app.
We use a hybrid model of p2p, in which a server helps the peers to find each other.
The game itself is then played by the peers without any communication to the server.

Implementation

Find Game
-> connection to server (create/join games)
-> server broadcasts created games and connects players

Play Game
-> players select unique identifier
-> randomly choose sequence
-> game gets shuffled and starts
-> each player saves the game on his device
-> token travels around (active player)
-> decision gets broadcasted

Additional challenge
Implement it as "mental poker", each player only knows own cards. Comes
with lots of challenges, particularly with regard to encryption and players
disconnecting.
