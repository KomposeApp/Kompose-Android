Hi!
I'll have the pleasure of introducing you to Kompose, our playlist application.

First, connect your device to the audio system.
Then open kompose, create a new party and add songs from youtube to the playlist.
Those are downloaded, and will be played as soon as they are available.

Now other members can join your party, and they will see the playlist on their own device.

They can even add their own songs to the play queue.

As a bonus, we've added a downvote button which can shield you from shitty music: 
if enough members dislike a song, it is removed from the play queue.

The app is available on the ... store.

come see us late for a demonstration, thanks for your attention!
