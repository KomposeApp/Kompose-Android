welcome audience

we will present you the newest, sexiest app for android

do you know the problem, when you're with friends and one of them occupies the music box with real shitty music all night long?

the only solution to this problem is hijacking the station to play YOUR awesome songs, which often ends in a little fight.

We are very friendly people and embrace peace, therefore we thought of a solution, to this awful problem:

KOMPOSE!!!

long story short we created a distributed playlist that anyone can add songs to. 


As you can see on the picture, everyone that makes part of a party can add their favorite music to the playlist.

to not expose you to shitty music, we added a fair voting system:
if a majority of clients downvotes a song, it will be removed from the queue.

if the eth policy allows it, we will make it available opensource, else you can soon find it on google play store, dont miss to download!!!

We wish you awesome nights with your friends with the best music.

Thanks and come see us later.
