Have you ever been out with friends and one of them occupies the music box with real shitty music all night long?
Till now, the only solution to this problem is hijacking the station, and force YOUR own songs to be played.

As this tends to end in fights, and as we tend to lose those fights, we've needed another solution.

Meet Kompose.

First, connect your device to the audio system.
Then open kompose, create a new party and add songs from youtube to the playlist.
Those are downloaded, and will be played as soon as they are available.

Now other members can join your party, and they will see the playlist on their own device.

They can even add their own songs to the play queue.

As a bonus, we've added a downvote button which can shield you from shitty music: 
If enough members dislike a song, it is removed.

The app is available on the ... store.

Come see us late for a demonstration, thanks for your attention!
